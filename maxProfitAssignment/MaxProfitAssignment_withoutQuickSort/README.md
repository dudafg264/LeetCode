# MaxProfitAssignment Function

The `MaxProfitAssignment` function calculates the maximum profit by assigning jobs to workers based on their abilities. Here’s a breakdown:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `profit_r` array stores the maximum profit each worker can earn.
   - `sum` tracks the total profit.

2. **Iterating over workers**: 
   - The function checks for each worker which jobs they can perform (worker’s ability ≥ job’s difficulty).

3. **Finding Maximum Profit**: 
   - For each job the worker can perform, it compares the job’s profit with the worker’s current max profit and updates if necessary.

4. **Accumulating Profit**: 
   - The worker’s maximum profit is added to the total `sum`.

5. **Return the Total Profit**: 
   - The function returns the total accumulated profit.

### `main` Function

The `main` function handles user input and displays the result:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - Prompts the user to input job details and worker abilities.
   
2. **Calling `MaxProfitAssignment`**:
   - The function computes the maximum profit based on the given input.

3. **Output the Result**:
   - Displays the total profit.

4. **Memory Management**:
   - Frees dynamically allocated memory for arrays after computation.

### Memory Management

- **Dynamic Memory Allocation**: 
   - `malloc` is used for `difficulty`, `profit`, and `worker` arrays to handle dynamic input sizes.
   
- **Freeing Allocated Memory**: 
   - After processing, `free()` is used to release the memory.

### Potential Improvements

- **Sorting**: Sorting jobs and workers first could improve the time complexity.
- **Edge Case Handling**: Handle scenarios like no worker being able to perform any job.
- **Error Checking**: Add input validation for incorrect values.
